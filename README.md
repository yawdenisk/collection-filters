# Software for collection filters
Welcome to my project, which was developed for working with collections and also to demonstrate your skills in writing code.

## Overview

This project implements a filtering system for a collection of `Person` objects. The goal is to provide functionality for filtering, calculating statistics, and paginating results based on various search parameters.

## Features

- **Filtering**: Ability to filter `Person` objects based on criteria such as age, name, income, and gender.
- **Calculations**: Support for various calculations, including summing and averaging specified fields (e.g., age, income).
- **Pagination**: Implemented pagination to manage large datasets, allowing users to view results page by page.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable with new filters and calculations
